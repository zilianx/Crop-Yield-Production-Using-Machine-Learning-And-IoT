## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-And-IoT.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-And-IoT

# Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login flask-wtf flask-mail catboost scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
pip install email_validator
python 3.10

# Run the Flask web app
python main.py

```

## 🌐 Usage
1. Start the Flask server.  
2. Open the web app in your browser.  
3. Register or log in to your account.  
4. Enter crop type, location, and season to get yield predictions.  
5. View real-time IoT sensor data and insights.  
6. Receive alerts or automated irrigation control based on predictions.  

---

## 📊 System Workflow
1. IoT sensors collect environmental and soil data.  
2. The Flask server receives and stores it in MongoDB.  
3. The ML model (CatBoost) processes the data and predicts yield.  
4. Results and recommendations are displayed on the web dashboard.
